- [Create-Python-App](https://github.com/WuzNab/3110-Group-Project-Python-Numerical-Literal-Checker/commit/7a9144cfb2cb61358a0b27b41d6c0a6a20279a8e)
## Features
- Command Line Python Literal Tool
- Validate Python Numeric Literals and Floating Points
- Read from in.txt file
- Write to out.txt file the result
## Usage
Found within Python_App is the .py application and in.txt and out.txt.
in.txt is the input file, ensure it has the name "in.txt".
out.txt is the output file, after the app is run you will find the true false output there.
